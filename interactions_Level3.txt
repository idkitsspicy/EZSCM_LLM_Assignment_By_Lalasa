You: "What is the distance between Earth and Mars?"

> what is the distance between earth mars
(LLM) The distance between Earth and Mars is constantly changing due to their elliptical orbits around the Sun.  Therefore, there isn't a single, fixed distance. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Closest Approach (Perihelion):** Around **54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles)**. This occurs when Earth is at its farthest point from the Sun (aphelion) and Mars is at its closest point to the Sun (perihelion), and they are lined up on the same side of the Sun.

*   **Farthest Distance (Aphelion):** Around **401 million kilometers (249 million miles)**. This happens when both planets are on opposite sides of the Sun at their farthest points.

*   **Average Distance:** About **225 million kilometers (140 million miles)**.

**Key takeaway:** You'll often see the closest approach distance quoted because it's the most favorable time for sending spacecraft to Mars, requiring the least amount of travel time and fuel.
